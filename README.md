# Total-Alcohol-Sales
This is a term project done in RStudio for my upper-level data forecasting class. The crux of the project is forecasting total alcohol sales in a county. In this team project, we use several forecasting and regression methods, inlduing ARIMA, univariate VAR, multivariate VAR, ETS, day-ahead forecasting, and multivariate forecasting. I don't have access to the code for this project. However, a general overview of the methods used and results is displayed and discussed in detail in the PDF document attached to the repository.
